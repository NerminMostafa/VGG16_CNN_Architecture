# VGG-16 CNN Architecture
Comparing between VGG-16 architecture from scratch and using transfer learning approach (pre-trained VGG-16 on ImageNet dataset).

- VGG-16 from Scratch on CIFAR-10 Dataset Achieved Accuracy Score = 10.0 %
- Pre-trained VGG-16 on CIFAR-10 Dataset Achieved Accuracy Score = 56.8 % (Note: I trained batch from the data)
- VGG-16 from Scratch on MNIST Dataset Achieved Accuracy Score = 11.35 %
- Pre-trained VGG-16 on MNIST Dataset Achieved Accuracy Score = 11.35 %
